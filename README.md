Lately i've taken a liking in trading the Dow Jones Index, so I created this open source project in the hopes to analyse the market better.

run this terminal command to run the code:

python3 us30watch.py

this command should work in any unix based shell (ssh,zsh,Mac,Ubunutu,Linux etc.)

As of my 2nd commit I havent made the program fully useful/profitable because im still in the planning phase of this project.
So obviously if you try to use this as an indicator for US30, please at your own discretion.
